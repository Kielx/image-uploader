## Overview

The project was a challenge from [Image-Uploader](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx).
In this simple-looking project, I had to incorporate React, Redux, and Firebase together to create an image uploader that can serve as a cornerstone for future projects.

### The challenge

Create an Image Uploader application. Use any front-end libraries of your choice. Create your API. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- I can drag and drop an image to upload it
- I can choose to select an image from my folder
- I can see a loader when uploading
- When the image is uploaded, I can see the image and copy it
- I can choose to copy to the clipboard

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com//)

### What I learned

This was my first project using Firebase and Redux. It allowed to me grasp those concepts in a simple but effective way.
Also, another solid step in my Frontend React and TailwindCSS skills.
